Certainly! Below is the Python code for backtesting an Elliott Wave trading strategy using the backtesting.py library. Note that the actual wave identification and other complex parts of the Elliott Wave strategy would require a more advanced implementation with pattern recognition, which is not included in the simple example below. The code presents a skeleton for how such a backtest might be set up.

```python
from backtesting import Backtest, Strategy
from backtesting.lib import crossover
from backtesting.test import GOOG  # Sample data

# Your data input will replace GOOG
# It should have columns: 'Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Close', 'Volume'

class ElliottWaveStrategy(Strategy):
    def init(self):
        # Initialization logic, e.g.:
        # self.waves = self.I(self.detect_waves, self.data['Close'])
        pass

    def detect_waves(self, data):
        # This function should implement Elliott Wave detection,
        # which requires in-depth pattern recognition and analysis.
        pass

    def next(self):
        # In a real strategy, we would analyze waves here and make trade decisions
        
        # Example (simplified trade logic for illustration only):
        if len(self.trades) == 0:
            # Trying to buy at the end of what might be a Wave 2
            # For the actual strategy, a Fibonacci retracement could be used to determine entry
            if self.data.Close[-1] > self.data.Close[-2]:
                self.buy()

        elif self.trades:
            # Exiting the trade at the end of what might be a Wave 5
            # The actual strategy should use Elliott Wave and Fibonacci extension to determine exit
            if self.data.Close[-1] < self.data.Close[-2]:
                self.position.close()

# Backtest the strategy
bt = Backtest(GOOG, ElliottWaveStrategy,
              cash=10000, commission=.002,
              exclusive_orders=True)

output = bt.run()
print(output)

# To plot the results (not available in the current environment)
# bt.plot()
```

Please remember that the actual implementation of Elliott Wave identification is complex and is not covered by this code. To apply backtesting.py for Elliott Wave, even after the actual wave identification implementation, significant customization and auxiliary functions would be required.
