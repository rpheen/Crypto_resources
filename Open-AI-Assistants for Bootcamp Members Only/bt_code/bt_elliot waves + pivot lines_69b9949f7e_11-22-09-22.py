This is a high-level implementation of the backtest for the Elliott Wave and Pivot Lines strategy using the backtesting.py library. It includes dummy functions for identifying Elliott wave patterns and calculating pivot points since actual implementations would require complex pattern recognition and data analysis which are beyond the scope of backtesting.py's built-in functionality.

Remember, the actual Elliott Wave pattern identification and correct pivot point calculation will require custom algorithms or integration with other libraries that provide this functionality. Adjust the dummy functions `identify_elliott_wave_pattern` and `calculate_pivot_points` with actual logic to get meaningful backtest results.
