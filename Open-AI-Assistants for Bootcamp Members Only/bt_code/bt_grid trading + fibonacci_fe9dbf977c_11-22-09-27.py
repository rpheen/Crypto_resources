Note that due to the complexity of the strategy, especially the continuous recalibration of Fib levels and the dynamic equity allocation, the provided code is a simplified version assuming static Fib levels for the duration of the backtest, and constant position sizes. A more sophisticated backtest might reevaluate the Fib levels on a more frequent basis and dynamically adjust the grid and position sizes.
