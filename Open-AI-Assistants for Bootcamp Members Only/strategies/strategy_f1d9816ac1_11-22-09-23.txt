A Bollinger Bands-based trading strategy involves using a set of three lines plotted in relation to the price of a security. The middle line is a simple moving average (SMA) typically set to a default of 20 periods, and the upper and lower bands are set at a specified number of standard deviations away from the moving average (usually two standard deviations). Here is a detailed strategy utilizing Bollinger Bands for trading:

### Bollinger Bands Trading Strategy

#### Strategy Assumptions:
- We are trading a liquid asset (like a stock, currency pair, or commodity).
- We use daily data (closing prices) for calculations.
- The Bollinger Bands are calculated with a 20-day SMA for the middle band and the upper/lower bands at 2 standard deviations from the SMA.
- We assume transaction costs and slippage are negligible.

#### Entry and Exit Rules:
- **Buy Signal (Long Entry)**: A buy signal occurs when the price closes below the lower Bollinger Band. The rationale is that the price has moved too far from the mean and might bounce back.
- **Sell Signal (Short Entry)**: A sell signal occurs when the price closes above the upper Bollinger Band. The rationale is that the price may be overextended and could pull back.
- **Exit Long Position (Take Profit for Long)**: Close the long position when the price touches or closes back above the middle Bollinger Band (SMA).
- **Exit Short Position (Take Profit for Short)**: Close the short position when the price touches or closes back below the middle Bollinger Band.
- Alternatively, a trailing stop loss can be used instead of a take profit level.
- **Stop-Loss**: For long positions, set a stop-loss below the recent swing low. For short positions, set a stop-loss above the recent swing high.
  
#### Money Management:
- Only risk 1-2% of trading capital on any single trade.
- Position size is adjusted based on the stop-loss distance to maintain the risk level.

#### Additional Rules:
- **Filter**: Implement a trend filter to take only those trades that align with the predominant trend. For example, only take long trades if the price is above a longer-term SMA (e.g., 50-day or 200-day SMA). Conversely, only take short trades if the price is below the longer-term SMA.
- **Time Filter**: Avoid taking new trades during periods of low liquidity or high volatility, such as outside of major market hours or around major news releases.

#### Strategy Coding Instructions for Backtest:
1. Import historical daily price data for the chosen asset.
2. Calculate the 20-day SMA for the middle Bollinger Band.
3. Calculate the upper and lower Bollinger Bands as 2 standard deviations away from the SMA.
4. Identify buy and sell signals based on price crossing the lower and upper bands, respectively.
5. Code the exit signals based on price touching the SMA or reaching the stop-loss level.
6. Keep track of trades and position sizes.
7. Calculate the performance metrics, including total return, maximum drawdown, and the Sharpe ratio.

#### Performance Metrics:
- Total Return: The percentage change in the account balance from the beginning to the end of the backtest period.
- Maximum Drawdown: The largest peak-to-trough decline in the account balance during the backtest period.
- Sharpe Ratio: A measure of risk-adjusted performance, calculated as the average return minus the risk-free rate, divided by the standard deviation of returns.
