Certainly! Here's a trading strategy that combines the use of Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) and Bollinger Bands:

## Strategy Overview:

### Indicators:

- **Exponential Moving Average (EMA):** A type of moving average that places a greater weight and significance on the most recent data points. Typically, traders use two EMAs with different time periods (e.g., 50-period EMA and 200-period EMA).

- **Bollinger Bands:** A volatility indicator developed by John Bollinger that consists of a middle band (which is an SMA or EMA), an upper band and a lower band at standard deviations (usually set at 2) above and below the middle band.

### Entry Criteria:

- **Long Entry (Buy Signal):**
  1. The short-term EMA (e.g., 50-period) crosses above the longer-term EMA (e.g., 200-period) indicating a bullish trend.
  2. The price touches or dips just below the lower Bollinger Band, suggesting it may be oversold.
  3. Buy when the price starts to rebound upwards from the lower Bollinger Band.

- **Short Entry (Sell Signal):**
  1. The short-term EMA (e.g., 50-period) crosses below the longer-term EMA (e.g., 200-period) indicating a bearish trend.
  2. The price touches or goes just above the upper Bollinger Band, suggesting it may be overbought.
  3. Sell when the price starts to decline from the upper Bollinger Band.

### Exit Criteria:

- **Long Exit:**
  1. When the price touches or reaches the upper Bollinger Band.
  2. Optional: Exit if the short-term EMA crosses below the long-term EMA.

- **Short Exit:**
  1. When the price touches or reaches the lower Bollinger Band.
  2. Optional: Exit if the short-term EMA crosses above the long-term EMA.

### Additional Considerations:

- **Stop Loss:** Set a stop loss to manage risk. This could be a percentage of the trade value, a fixed dollar amount, or based on a technical level like beyond the opposite Bollinger Band.
- **Take Profit:** Set take profit targets at a predefined risk-reward ratio or let the Bollinger Band criteria be the sole exit point.
- **Volume Confirmation:** To avoid false signals, confirm the breakout with an increase in volume.
- **Timeframe:** The strategy can be applied on various timeframes, but it must be consistent across all indicators used.
- **Position Sizing:** Use appropriate position sizing to manage risk effectively.

### Risk Management:

- Risk no more than 1-2% of the total trading capital on a single trade.
- Adjust the number of shares/contracts based on the distance to the stop loss to maintain consistent risk per trade.

## Backtesting Guidelines for AI:

To code a backtest for this strategy, here are the steps the AI should follow:

1. **Import Historical Data**: Load historical price data that includes high, low, close, and volume information.
2. **Compute Indicators**: Calculate the two EMAs and the upper and lower Bollinger Bands.
3. **Signal Generation**: Loop through the historical data to identify buy and sell signals based on the strategy's entry criteria.
4. **Trade Execution**: Simulate trade entries at the signal price on the next bar's open and exits at the price dictated by the exit criteria.
5. **Tracking Trades**: Keep a log of all trades, including entry and exit points, to calculate performance metrics.
6. **Performance Metrics**: At the end of the backtest, compute key metrics such as net profit, percentage profitability, maximum drawdown, and Sharpe ratio.
7. **Visualization**: Plot equity curves and indicator overlays to visually inspect the strategy's performance.

Remember, past performance is not indicative of future results, and there's always a risk in trading based on historical data. This strategy should be further refined and tested under different market conditions.
