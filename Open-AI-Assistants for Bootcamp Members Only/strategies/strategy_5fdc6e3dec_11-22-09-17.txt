Creating an Elliott Wave trading strategy involves several steps. The Elliott Wave principle is a form of technical analysis that traders use to analyze financial market cycles and forecast market trends by identifying extremes in investor psychology, highs and lows in prices, and other collective factors.

Here is a detailed trading strategy based on the Elliott Wave principle:

1. **Identify the Market Phase:**
    - **Impulsive Waves:** These are the trends that move in the direction of the overall trend and are labeled as waves 1, 3, and 5.
    - **Corrective Waves:** These counter the main trend and are labeled as waves 2 and 4.

2. **Wave Identification Criteria:**
    - Wave 2 should not retrace more than 100% of Wave 1.
    - Wave 3 should never be the shortest of the three impulse waves.
    - Wave 4 should not overlap with Wave 1 except in a diagonal triangle.

3. **Finding Entry Points:**
    - **Buying on Wave 2 or 4:** Following the completion of Wave 1 or 3, traders should look for retracements that do not violate the start of the previous wave. A common Fibonacci retracement level (such as 50% or 61.8%) of the previous wave can be used to enter.
    - **Selling on Wave 5:** Identify the end of Wave 4 and the start of Wave 5 to short-sell with the anticipation that Wave 5 may complete soon.

4. **Stop-Loss and Take-Profit Levels:**
    - Stop-loss orders should be placed just beyond the retracement point of the prior wave. For instance, for a Wave 2 entry, a stop-loss can be placed below the start of Wave 1.
    - Take-profit targets can be determined by projecting the lengths of previous waves or using Fibonacci extension levels.

5. **Risk Management:**
    - Traders should only risk a small percentage of their trading capital on any single trade, often suggested between 1% and 2%.

6. **Additional Confirmations (Optional):**
    - Traders may use additional technical indicators such as RSI (Relative Strength Index), MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence), or stochastic oscillator for further confirmation of the wave count or to signal potential reversals.

7. **Backtesting the Strategy:**
    - Historical data should be used to test the strategy. An AI or backtesting software would have to:
        - Detect potential wave structures according to rules and guidelines of the Elliott Wave principle.
        - Identify entry and exit points based on the strategy.
        - Consider slippage, transaction costs, and other real-world trading considerations.
        - Evaluate the strategy's performance using various metrics like win-rate, return-on-investment (ROI), drawdowns, etc.

8. **Strategy Adjustments and Optimization:**
    - Based on the backtesting results, adjust the parameters of the strategy, such as entry/exit criteria, stop loss, and take-profit levels.
    - Refine wave identification rules or incorporate additional technical indicators if necessary.

9. **Forward Testing:**
    - After optimization, run the strategy on out-of-sample data to verify its effectiveness.

Remember that the Elliott Wave theory, like any other trading strategy, cannot predict market movements with perfect accuracy. It is always recommended to use risk management practices and to combine Elliott Wave analysis with other forms of analysis to validate trading decisions.

Before coding and backtesting such a strategy, a developer would need to create algorithms for wave identification and count validation, which requires a deep understanding of both the market being traded and the Elliott Wave principles.
