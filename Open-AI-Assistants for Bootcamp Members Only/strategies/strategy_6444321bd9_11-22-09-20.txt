Sure, let's design a trading strategy using the Average Directional Index (ADX). The ADX is an indicator of trend strength, and is typically used to determine if a market is range-bound or trending.

### ADX Trading Strategy

#### Overview
- **Objective**: Capitalize on strong trends by entering trades when the ADX indicates a strong trend and exiting when the trend weakens.
- **Instruments**: This strategy can be applied to any market (stocks, forex, commodities, etc.), but it's especially useful in markets known to trend.
- **Time Frame**: Daily charts are commonly used, but the strategy can be applied to other time frames for intra-day, swing, or long-term trading.

#### Indicators
- **Average Directional Index (ADX)**: To measure trend strength. A threshold of 25 is often used to distinguish between trending and non-trending conditions.
- **Plus Directional Indicator (+DI)**: To measure the presence of an uptrend.
- **Minus Directional Indicator (-DI)**: To measure the presence of a downtrend.

#### Trade Entry
- **Long Entry**: When +DI crosses above -DI, and the ADX is above 25 (indicating a strong uptrend).
- **Short Entry**: When -DI crosses above +DI, and the ADX is above 25 (indicating a strong downtrend).

#### Trade Exit
- **Long Exit**: When +DI crosses below -DI, or when ADX falls below a threshold (e.g., 20), signaling the trend may be weakening.
- **Short Exit**: When -DI crosses below +DI, or when ADX falls below a threshold (e.g., 20), signaling the trend may be weakening.

#### Risk Management
- Position size based on a predetermined amount of account equity (e.g., 1-2% risk per trade).
- Stop losses set below recent support for long positions or above recent resistance for short positions.
- Profit targets set at a multiple of risk (e.g., a 2:1 or 3:1 reward-to-risk ratio), or exits can be dynamic based on the -DI/+DI crossover.

#### Additional Considerations
- Filters such as moving averages or price action can be added to fine-tune entries and exits.
- The strategy can incorporate trailing stop losses to capitalize on prolonged trends while protecting against reversals.
- The strategy should be backtested over multiple market conditions (bullish, bearish, sideways) to ensure robustness.

This is a basic outline for a trend-following strategy using the ADX. You may refine it further by considering market-specific characteristics or combining it with other technical or fundamental indicators.

Would you like to proceed with coding a backtest for this strategy, or is there any aspect of the strategy that you would like to modify or expand upon?
