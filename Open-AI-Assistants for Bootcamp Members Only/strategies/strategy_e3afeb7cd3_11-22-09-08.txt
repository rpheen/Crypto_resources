Certainly! Below is a trading strategy that uses the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) indicators.

## Trading Strategy: RSI + VWAP

### Objective:
The strategy seeks to exploit the confluence of RSI momentum signals with the VWAP's measure of the average price a security has traded at throughout the day, based on both volume and price. The goal is to identify overbought or oversold conditions in the context of the average traded price.

### Instruments:
This strategy can be applied to stocks, forex, futures, or any other tradeable instrument where RSI and VWAP indicators are applicable.

### Time Frame:
The strategy is designed for intraday trading with a focus on a timeframe of 5 minutes to 1 hour.

### Indicators:
1. **Relative Strength Index (RSI)** - a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. RSI oscillates between zero and 100. 
    - Overbought Threshold: 70
    - Oversold Threshold: 30

2. **Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP)** - a trading benchmark used especially in pension plans. VWAP is calculated by adding up the dollars traded for every transaction (price multiplied by the number of shares traded) and then dividing by the total shares traded.

### Entry Criteria:
**Buy Signal**:
- The RSI crosses above the oversold threshold (30) signaling a potential reversal in trend.
- The price is below VWAP, indicating that the security is trading at a lower price compared to the day's average.
- After the above conditions are met, a buy order is placed when the price crosses above VWAP.

**Sell Signal/Short Entry**:
- The RSI crosses below the overbought threshold (70) signaling a potential reversal in trend.
- The price is above VWAP, suggesting that the security is trading at a higher price compared to the day's average.
- After the above conditions are met, a sell or short order is placed when the price crosses below VWAP.

### Exit Criteria:
**For a Long Position**:
- The RSI crosses above the overbought threshold (70), indicating the potential end of the bullish momentum.
- The price crosses below the VWAP.

**For a Short Position**:
- The RSI crosses below the oversold threshold (30), indicating the potential end of the bearish momentum.
- The price crosses above the VWAP.

### Stop Loss and Take Profit:
- Set a stop loss at a certain percentage or price level away from the entry point to manage risk.
- Set a take profit at a target that is a multiple of the risk (for example, 2 times the stop loss).

### Position Sizing:
Determine the position size based on the risk management rules (e.g., risking no more than 1-2% of total capital on a single trade).

### Backtesting Elements for the AI:

1. **Data Preparation**: Import or simulate intraday price data with volume.
2. **Indicator Calculation**: Calculate RSI and VWAP values for the desired timeframe.
3. **Signal Generation**: Develop logic to identify buy and sell signals based on entry and exit criteria.
4. **Trade Execution**: Simulate trade entries and exits based on signals and manage positions.
5. **Risk Management**: Ensure stop losses and take profits are well-defined and adhered to.
6. **Performance Metrics**: Calculate net profit, risk/reward ratio, win rate, and other relevant metrics.
7. **Optimization and Sensitivity Analysis**: Adjust the parameters of RSI and VWAP for optimization.

### Caveats:
- Slippage, transaction costs, and market impact are not accounted for in this strategy outline but should be considered during live trading.
- Past performance does not guarantee future results. It is essential to backtest the strategy with historical data before live implementation.

Now, an AI coder can use this detailed strategy to create a backtest that will simulate how the strategy would have performed using historical data. The backtest will include the application of the RSI and VWAP indicators, execution of trades based on the signals generated by these indicators, and calculation of performance metrics to analyze the strategy's efficacy.
