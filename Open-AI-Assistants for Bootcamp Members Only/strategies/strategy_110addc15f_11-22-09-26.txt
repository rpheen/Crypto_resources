Creating a trading strategy using grid trading in conjunction with Fibonacci levels involves combining the concepts of both techniques. Here's a step-by-step guide to detail such a strategy:

### 1. Identifying the Trading Range
**Objective:** Find a range in the market where the price has shown significant support and resistance.

### 2. Calculating Fibonacci Levels
**Objective:** Within the determined range, calculate key Fibonacci retracement levels (e.g., 23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, and 78.6%).

### 3. Setting Up Grid Levels
**Objective:** Use the Fibonacci levels to set up grid levels or price levels at which trades will be executed.

### 4. Determining Position Size
**Objective:** Decide on the size of the position to be traded at each grid level.

### 5. Execution Rules
**Objective:** Define the rules for entering and exiting trades.

### Strategy Details:
1. **Identify Major High and Low:**
   - Find the most recent significant high (peak) and low (trough) in the price chart over a set period (e.g., 3 months, 6 months).
    
2. **Draw Fibonacci Levels:**
   - Draw the Fibonacci retracement levels from the low to the high if the market is in uptrend, and high to low if in downtrend.
   
3. **Set Grid Levels:**
   - Set grid levels at each Fibonacci retracement level. Additional levels can be added between major Fibonacci levels if finer grids are desired.
   
4. **Determine Position Sizes:**
   - The position size could be uniform across all levels or varied based on certain criteria (e.g., increased size at higher retracement levels).
   
5. **Trade Execution:**
   - **Buy Orders:**
     - Place buy limit orders at each retracement level below the current market price.
     - Optionally, place a stop loss for each position a few pips below the next retracement level or a predetermined fixed distance.
   - **Sell Orders:**
     - Place sell limit orders at each retracement level above the current market price.
     - Optionally, place a stop loss for each position a few pips above the next retracement level or a predetermined fixed distance.
   
6. **Take Profit and Stop Loss:**
   - Set take-profit orders a predefined number of pips away from the entry point or at the next Fibonacci level.
   - Set stop-loss orders based on a fixed percentage of the account balance or at a previous grid level.
   
7. **Risk Management:**
   - Define the total risk for all open positions (e.g., not more than 3% of the account balance).
  
8. **Monitoring and Adjustment:**
   - As the market moves, cancel unfilled orders that are no longer within the grid's range.
   - Move the grid up or down in line with market trends, recalibrating Fibonacci levels as new highs and lows form.

9. **Exiting the Strategy:**
   - The strategy can be exited manually based on market conditions or technical indicators indicating a trend change, or automatically after a set time period.
   
10. **Backtesting Parameters:**
   - Define historical data period for backtesting.
   - Set the initial account balance.
   - Include transaction costs in the calculations (spreads, commissions).
   - Set the timeframe for reviewing and adjusting the grid (e.g., daily, weekly).
   - Determine the metrics for evaluating the strategy's performance (e.g., return on investment, maximum drawdown).

The described strategy is relatively complex and requires constant monitoring and adjustment as the market evolves. It would be suitable for intermediate to advanced traders who understand Fibonacci retracement tools and are familiar with grid trading concepts.

To code a backtest for this strategy, an AI or automated system would need access to historical price data, technical analysis libraries (for calculating Fibonacci levels), and a way to simulate trades and track performance over time. Would you like me to assist you in outlining pseudo-code for such backtesting, or do you need further clarification on the strategy itself?
