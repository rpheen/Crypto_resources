To create a trading strategy using the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), we first need to define the components of the MACD and the rules for entry and exit based on its signals. Here's a step-by-step outline to construct such a strategy:

### Components of MACD:
1. **MACD Line**: It is calculated by subtracting the 26-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) from the 12-period EMA.
2. **Signal Line**: It is the 9-period EMA of the MACD Line.
3. **Histogram**: It is the difference between the MACD Line and the Signal Line.

### Strategy Rules:

#### Entry (Buy Signal):
1. A buy signal occurs when the MACD Line crosses above the Signal Line, indicating a potential upward trend.
2. To filter out noise and confirm the trend, one might require the histogram to be positive for a certain number of periods or the MACD Line to remain above the Signal Line for a few periods before entering.

#### Exit (Sell Signal):
1. A sell signal is triggered when the MACD Line crosses below the Signal Line, suggesting a potential downward trend.
2. As with the buy signal, one might require the histogram to be negative for a certain number of periods or the MACD Line to stay below the Signal Line for a few periods before exiting.

#### Additional Conditions:
- **Filter**: To avoid false signals, one might also introduce additional filters, such as the price being above a longer-term moving average before executing a buy order.
- **Stop Loss/Take Profit**: Set a stop loss to limit the potential loss (e.g., a percentage drop from the purchase price) and a take-profit level to realize gains.

### Parameters:
1. **Short EMA Period**: 12
2. **Long EMA Period**: 26
3. **Signal EMA Period**: 9
4. **Buy Confirmation Periods**: 2 (optional, for trend confirmation)
5. **Sell Confirmation Periods**: 2 (optional, for trend confirmation)
6. **Additional Moving Average Filter**: 50-period EMA (optional)
7. **Stop Loss Percentage**: 5% (optional)
8. **Take Profit Percentage**: 10% (optional)

### Backtest Procedure:
1. **Calculate EMAs**: Calculate the 12-period and 26-period EMAs of the closing prices.
2. **Compute MACD Line**: Subtract the 26-period EMA from the 12-period EMA.
3. **Generate Signal Line**: Calculate the 9-period EMA of the MACD Line.
4. **Determine the Histogram**: Subtract the Signal Line from the MACD Line.
5. **Identify Buy/Sell Signals**: Apply entry and exit conditions based on the signals generated from the MACD and Signal Line crossovers.
6. **Record Transactions**: For each signal, record the transaction, including the price, date, and whether it is a buy or sell.
7. **Implement Filters**: If using filters such as confirmation periods or additional EMAs, make sure to apply these before executing trades.
8. **Apply Stop Loss/Take Profit**: If set, execute the sell order when the price hits the stop loss or take profit level.
9. **Evaluate Performance**: Summarize the performance of the strategy by calculating metrics such as total return, percent profitable trades, maximum drawdown, etc.

With this strategy blueprint, another AI or developer could code a backtest by following these steps and adjusting the parameters as needed to fit their platform and risk profile. The backtest should be applied to historical price data of a chosen financial instrument over a significant time frame to assess the effectiveness of the strategy.
